This project is a frontend technical assignment built using Next.js App Router, 
Material UI, and Redux Toolkit. The application demonstrates authentication, 
protected routes, and a paginated users dashboard using DummyJSON APIs.

Tech Stacks:

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Material UI (MUI)
- DummyJSON public APIs

Implemented Features:

- Admin login using DummyJSON authentication API
- Authentication state management using Redux Toolkit
- Protected dashboard routes
- Users list page with API-side pagination
- Responsive UI built using Material UI components
- Clean and modular project structure

Design & Architecture Decisions:

- Chose Redux Toolkit over Zustand due to familiarity and clarity
- Implemented API-side pagination for better performance
- Used component-level route guards instead of middleware for simplicity
- Prioritized clean UI and stable core functionality over feature quantity

How to Run?

- npm install
- npm run dev
